To configure DataStax Enterprise Service Broker for Pivotal Platform, navigate to the tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the tile to open its configuration tabs, and select the **Settings** tab.

The **Settings** tab includes the standard configuration panes **Assign AZs and Networks**, **Errands**, **Resource Config**, and **Stemcell**, shared by all Ops Manager tiles. 

The **Settings** tab also contains the following four product-specific panes:

## <a id='service'></a>Service Settings

This pane includes the following fields:

* **Service name** to appear in Apps Manager.

* **Service CLI name** to use with Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) commands, such as `cf create-service`.

* **Service description** in the services marketplace.

## <a id='cluster'></a>Cassandra Cluster Settings

Pivotal Platform needs these fields from the external DataStax Enterprise cluster, to allow access:

* IP Address
* Port (default: `9042`)
* Admin username
* Admin password

Pivotal Platform uses the admin credentials to let users bind and unbind CF applications and manage users in DataStax Enterprise.

## <a id='plan'></a>Service Plans

In this pane you must define at least one plan, and you can define more. Each plan must have a **Plan Name** and **Plan Description**.

You can optionally set a **Cassandra Role** for each plan. When an app accesses DataStax Enterprise Cassandra through an instance of this plan, this is the Cassandra role that defines its permissions. If unset, the plan instance uses the admin credentials and has no Cassandra role assigned.

## <a id='access'></a>Service Access

By default, all service plans for the DataStax Enterprise service are private.

To make the service plans public, publishing them to the Services Marketplace, select **Enable global access to plans of service DataStax Cassandra Service Broker for Pivotal Platform**.
